# Java Program to calculate Strike rate And Economy Rate

## Description
Quite Often it is Observed that some people who follow cricket do not Understand the simple concept of Strike Rate and Economy Rate and often ignore it . So in to Order make the Calculation Process Simpler i tried to write a Java code for it!!.
This Project is a Simple Java Program Which Calculates the Strike and Economy rate of Cricketers by taking the input from the user.User Defined Methods are used to carry out the Calculation.

The Project contains two packages
  
**1.Cricket**

Files in Cricket are:-

* __Player__:-Contains Details of the Player   
* __sreateanderate__:-Contains User Defined methods calculate the statastics
* __TheCalculator__:-Its has the main part of the code Which excecutes the program using objects of different classes

**2.Statastics**

Files in Statastics are:-

* __Stats__:-It Contains the interface Stats which contains the methods to calculate Strike rate and Economy Rate

12. Use of 'super' keyword.
13. Packages.
14. Interfaces.
15. Exception Handling.

#### Concepts Left Out

I was Unable to Use the Concept of __Threads__ because while writing the code i was not able to find a effective way to implemnt it in my code which would improve the quality of the code.However,it can just be used to display a "goodbye" or "thank you" messege at the end.
